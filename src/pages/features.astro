        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Conversational AI</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Recognify’s core feature is centered around conversational artificial intelligence. This AI provides users with emotional support, reflective conversations, insights, and understanding. Unlike simple chatbots, Recognify's AI is designed using cognitive psychological models that mimic human mental processes during conversations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Most mental health and self-improvement AIs are limited to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), failing to account for individual uniqueness. Recognify’s AI tailors its approach to each person's unique qualities, desires, and burdens—adapting much like a life coach or therapist.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Greatness Garden</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Recognify is the world's first self-improvement platform that acknowledges the complexity of personal growth. Many digital solutions fail because they do not provide engagement, accountability, or continued motivation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Recognify’s **Greatness Garden** is an interactive virtual garden that visually symbolizes personal progress. As users advance toward their goals, their garden flourishes, creating a motivating and rewarding experience.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Personalized Exercises</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Achieving dreams isn’t easy, and self-improvement requires active effort. Recognify provides scientifically validated mental exercises that function like **workouts for the brain**—helping users reshape negative thoughts, reduce self-doubt, and build resilience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Unlike generic CBT assignments, Recognify personalizes these exercises based on each user’s goals, values, and challenges. This ensures that the exercises are **relevant, effective, and engaging** rather than just another task.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Reflection is an essential skill for growth, yet few people utilize it effectively. Recognify supports guided reflective cycles and journaling—two research-backed techniques that enhance well-being, career success, and relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Many people get trapped in unproductive rumination or fail to gain meaningful insights from experiences. Recognify ensures that reflection is **structured, productive, and enjoyable**, helping users step toward their dreams, one reflection at a time.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          Recognify is committed to **user privacy and data security**, following the highest standards, including **GDPR compliance**. Unlike many tech companies, Recognify does not sell or share user data with third parties or governments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mt-4">
          All conversations and actions are **fully anonymized** to protect users from data leaks or hacks. Additionally, Recognify only uses data for research purposes with **explicit user consent** and provides an easy way for users to request data deletion.
